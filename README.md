Papers from the DriverPass projects in class.
The DriverPass project was for a system to traain new students to be excellent and safe drivers.  The client was a imagined company called DriverPass.  They wanted a program that students could choose between different packages and learn all that they would need to for taking there driving test including scheduling in person lessons.
I think I did well on the UML designs that I made and on the papers I submitted here.
If I had to revise anything I am not sure what I would revise.  I still think I need to learn more though.
I think I interpreted the user's needs quite well within these documents.  It is always of the utmost inportanse to consider the needs of the user, or the system is a failure.  
I definately think in designing a system that the UML diagrams are a great thing and show what needs to be down with the system.
